# Цікаві факти про астероїди
FACTS = [
    "As of 2025-09-11 there are 39,123 known NEOs; 11,343 are >140 m, and 873 are >1 km.",
    "In the last 30 days, 12 NEOs passed closer to Earth than the Moon; over 365 days — 176.",
    "A 140 m asteroid strikes about once every ~20,000 years and makes a 1–2 km crater.",
    "A ~1 km object — about once every ~500,000 years; that’s regional-to-continental catastrophe scale.",
    "Meteoroids enter the atmosphere at 11–72 km/s; ~20 km/s is typical.",
    "Energy scales with v²: +50% in velocity → ×2.25 impact energy.",
    "Chelyabinsk 2013 (~20 m): airburst ≈470–500 kt TNT (~30 Hiroshima bombs).",
    "Meteor Crater (Arizona): a 1.2 km crater made by a ~50 m iron meteoroid.",
    "Stony bodies ~50 m mostly airburst; iron 30–50 m can already leave a crater (e.g., Meteor Crater).",
    "A 100 m stony asteroid at 20 km/s ≈ 75 Mt TNT — city-scale damage.",
    "A 140 m stony asteroid at 20 km/s ≈ 100–200 Mt TNT; PDC-2025 puts ~150 m at 45–160 Mt.",
    "A 1 km stony asteroid at 20 km/s ≈ 75,000 Mt TNT; Chicxulub (~10 km) is ~72 teratons.",
    "CNEOS predicted in advance the fall of a ~1 m asteroid over France (Feb 13, 2023) — early warning works.",
    "The DART mission shortened Dimorphos’s orbit by 32–33 minutes; measured Δv ≈ 2.7 mm/s (ejecta momentum boost ~2.2–4.9×).",
    "With ~6 months of lead time, Δv ≈ 25.5 cm/s can theoretically push an impactor off Earth-crossing (PDC-2021 scenario).",
    "In PDC-2025, a typical entry is ~13.7 km/s at ~67–69° — entry angle sets airburst height and damage zones.",
    "Crater scaling is nonlinear: 50 m iron → ~1.2 km crater; 140 m stony → 1–2 km; target geology and angle matter a lot.",
    "USGS 3DEP offers DEM at up to 1 m/pixel — enough to model local tsunami inundation and crater profiles in the U.S.",
    "Sentry (NASA/JPL) continuously scans the catalog and updates the risk table — current ‘yellow’ objects are visible online.",
    "Millimeters per second added years before encounter translate into thousands of kilometers of miss distance — that’s planetary defense."
