  <h1>What are meteorites made of?</h1>
  
  <p>
    According to NASA ARES, meteorites are traditionally divided into three major groups by material:
    <strong>stony</strong>, <strong>iron</strong>, and <strong>stony-iron</strong>.
    The division is based on texture and the content of silicates and metal (Fe–Ni).
  </p>

  <h2>Stony</h2>
  <p>
    The most common (&gt;95% of witnessed falls). They include <strong>chondrites</strong> and <strong>achondrites</strong>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Chondrites.</strong> Contain millimeter-sized “spheres” — <em>chondrules</em> — that formed ~4.5 billion years ago in the solar nebula.
      They preserve the earliest, “primitive” record of asteroid accretion.

    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Achondrites.</strong> Rocks without chondrules that underwent melting/differentiation; some originate from the Moon and Mars.
      They reveal volcanism and the “geology” of their parent bodies.
    </li>
  </ul>

    <strong>Example from NASA missions:</strong>
    The sample from asteroid <em>Bennu</em> (considered representative of the carbonaceous, “C-complex”) shows high contents of
    <strong>carbon</strong> and <strong>water</strong> — evidence that such bodies could have delivered the “building blocks of life” to early Earth.
    Water-bearing clay minerals are present.
  </div>

  <h2>Iron</h2>
  <p>
    Composed predominantly of <strong>iron–nickel</strong> metal; very dense. These are fragments of the
    <strong>cores of differentiated asteroids</strong> that cooled extraordinarily slowly; slices often show the
    <em>Widmanstätten pattern</em>.

    Such specimens directly reveal the internal structure of “minor planets” and the formation of their cores.

  </p>

  <h2>Stony-iron</h2>
  <p>
    Contain roughly equal amounts of metal and silicates; rare (&lt;2%).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Pallasites.</strong> Olivine crystals in a Fe–Ni metal framework; likely sourced from the <em>core–mantle boundary</em> of small bodies.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Mesosiderites.</strong> Mixed “metal + basalt” breccias indicating <strong>asteroid collisions</strong> and layer mixing — offering a cross-section of disruption and mixing processes in the early Solar System.
    </li>
