  <h1>Meteorite entry angle</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>How often and at what angles?</strong>
    If the flux of bodies in space is considered random, the most probable entry angle
    relative to the horizon is <strong>about 45°</strong>, and roughly half of events fall
    within <strong>~30–60°</strong>. This result is widely used in planetary science and
    risk models.

  <p><strong>How does angle affect crater shape and ejecta?</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>α ≳ 45° (moderate–steep entries).</strong>
      Craters are usually <em>nearly circular</em>, with ejecta that are more or less symmetric; asymmetry is modest.

    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>α ≈ 15–45° (oblique entries).</strong>
      Craters remain predominantly circular, but ejecta become <em>asymmetric</em>: there is more “downrange”
      along the trajectory, while “uprange” a depletion zone forms — a hallmark of oblique impacts.

    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>α ≲ 15° (very shallow entries).</strong>
      “<em>Butterfly</em>” ejecta patterns appear (two lobes with a minimum between them) and the structure shows
      greater elongation/ellipticity — the classic signature of a low angle in NASA/JPL imagery.

  <div class="article-fact">
    <strong>When can a body “skip” without striking the ground?</strong>
    At <em>a few degrees</em> above the horizon, <em>earth-grazers</em> are possible — meteoroids that skim the upper
    atmosphere and then exit back into space (like a stone “skipping” across water).

  <p>
    <strong>Ground effects also depend on angle.</strong>
    Shallow entries tend to shift energy and ejecta <em>downrange</em> and more often produce <em>airbursts</em> without a large crater;
    steeper entries transfer energy into the ground more efficiently and increase the chance of a distinct impact crater.
