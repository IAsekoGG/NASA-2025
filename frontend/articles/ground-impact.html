  <h1>Why the ground matters, too</h1>

  <p>
    Impact outcomes are determined not only by the bolide’s size and speed, but also by the nature of the target:
    its <strong>strength</strong>, <strong>density</strong>, <strong>porosity</strong>, and <strong>grain size</strong>.
    These factors control the crater’s shape, how much material is ejected, and how far it travels.

      <h3>Rock</h3>
      <p>
        In hard bedrock, the impact first excavates a transient “bowl,” then fractures and <em>spallation</em>
        (detachment of thin slabs) build a larger final crater. Ejecta are energetic, the rim is well defined,
        and rays extend far — a rocky target “holds” the impact well and returns much of the energy outward.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h3>Sand</h3>
      <p>
        A granular target behaves like a classic excavator: you get a rounded bowl with a broad carpet of ejecta around it.
        Most material comes from the near-surface layers, so the rays literally record the “fingerprint” of the surface.
        The edges slump more gently than in rock.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h3>Highly porous materials</h3>
      <p>
        Here the impact mainly collapses pores — producing a “<em>compaction crater</em>.” Ejecta are few or nearly absent,
        move slowly, and fall back quickly. In the field this looks like a clean bowl with no extensive rays and only a soft rim.

  <div class="note">
    The same bolide will leave a deeper, “harder” imprint with long rays in rock; in sand — a wider but gentler crater
    with a broad ejecta blanket; and in a super-porous target — a quiet impression with minimal scatter.
    One more detail: for oblique entries the rays shift <em>downrange</em> along the flight path — visible for all target types.
