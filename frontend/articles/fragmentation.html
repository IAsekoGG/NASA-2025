  <h1>Why does a meteoroid fragment?</h1>

    During entry, the dynamic pressure
    <span class="eq">&asymp; &frac12;&rho; v<sup>2</sup></span>
    rises. When it exceeds the body’s actual strength (often reduced by cracks and porosity), the object undergoes
    progressive fragmentation: part of the mass becomes a cloud of fine particles, and part remains as discrete
    fragments. This behavior is captured by <em>Fragment–Cloud</em>-type models, which combine a particle cloud with
    individual fragments and account for different internal structures (including <em>rubble-pile</em> bodies).

    Breakup at altitude lowers the likelihood of a large crater and a localized “point” catastrophe, because a
    significant fraction of the energy is released in the air. At the same time, it can strengthen the airburst:
    there exists an <em>optimal burst height</em> (Height-of-Burst) at which, for a given yield, the radius of
    hazardous overpressures at the surface is largest. Thus, fragmentation can reduce the <em>cratering</em> risk
    while increasing the <em>area</em> affected by the shock wave.

        The higher and faster the fragmentation occurs, the longer the fall “corridor” and the longer the
