  <h1>Tsunamis and “steam” plumes</h1>

  <p>
    For small and medium bodies (approximately &lt;≈250&nbsp;m), the expected tsunamis are generally
    modest: energy from an airburst couples weakly into the ocean surface, wave propagation is
    <em>dispersive</em> (shorter waves lose amplitude quickly), and on the continental shelf the
    Van&nbsp;Dorn effect further reduces it. Therefore, for typical scenarios the overall risk of
    large tsunamis and “steam” plumes is considered low.

    The initial wave height near the source increases with the body’s <strong>size</strong> and
    <strong>speed</strong> (via a larger transient cavity) and is roughly <strong>limited by the local
    depth</strong>; a direct impact into deep water yields a larger initial wave than an atmospheric
    explosion. In practice, sub-kilometer objects in the ocean produce local waves from a few to tens
    of meters that quickly lose energy en route to shore, whereas kilometer-scale bodies can generate
    extreme values (scale reference — Chicxulub models with open-ocean waves &gt;100&nbsp;m near the
    impact zone). The continental shelf can “break” even a strong wave packet before it reaches the
    coastline.

  <h2>“Steam” plumes</h2>
  <p>
    Noticeable vaporization effects are expected mainly for <strong>large and fast</strong> impacts:
    shock vaporization of water forms a rising <em>steam–aerosol</em> plume extending hundreds of
    kilometers. For sizes typical of planetary-defense scenarios (&lt;≈250&nbsp;m), these effects are
    usually <strong>minor</strong>.
