  <h1>Speeds of meteors and meteorites</h1>

  <p>
    At the heights where luminous flight begins, meteors travel at roughly
    <strong>12–72&nbsp;km/s</strong>.
    The lower bound is set by Earth’s gravity (a minimum of ~11&nbsp;km/s), while the upper bound corresponds to an almost
    “head-on” encounter with Earth at speeds near the parabolic limit in the Solar System (Earth itself moves at ~30&nbsp;km/s).
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>When does a fragment become a meteorite?</strong>
    After intense deceleration and ablation, the glow fades and the fragments enter <em>dark flight</em> —
    free fall at a <strong>terminal velocity of ~100–200&nbsp;m/s</strong>. It is at these speeds that most
    meteorites reach the ground.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Meteoroid entry speeds</strong> in most observations fall within the <em>tens of km/s</em>;
    particles from <em>meteor showers</em> are often very fast (frequently tens of km/s) and at the same time tiny
    (sand/dust-sized), so they <b>burn up completely</b> in the upper atmosphere. For this reason,
    <b>meteor showers usually don’t “drop” large meteorites</b>; actual meteorites most often originate from solitary,
    slower fireballs.

        <b>When does the glow fade?</b> Meteors stop incandescing at altitudes of
        <em>tens of kilometers</em>. What follows is <em>“dark flight”</em>: fragments fall for several minutes,
        moving in the general direction of the trajectory, but the fall becomes more vertical and depends on the wind.
        Because of wind and trajectory geometry, fragments often land <em>far from the spot where the last flare was seen</em>.
