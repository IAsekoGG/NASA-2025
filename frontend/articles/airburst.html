  <h1>Why does it explode in the atmosphere?</h1>

  <p>
    During entry, the dynamic pressure increases (&asymp;
    <span style="white-space:nowrap;">&frac12;&rho; v<sup>2</sup></span>).
    When it exceeds the body’s “effective” strength (weakened by cracks and porosity), the meteoroid
    fragments, its energy couples rapidly to the air, and an <em>airburst</em> occurs. For objects up to
    hundreds of meters, this scenario is typical; a scale example is the Chelyabinsk event: an explosion at
    ~20–23&nbsp;km altitude produced a powerful shock wave without a ground impact.
  </p>

  <h2>Why consequences can be worse than a water or ground impact</h2>
  <p>
    An airburst efficiently converts energy into a <strong>broad ground-level blast</strong> with a large
    radius of overpressure. For a given yield there is a burst altitude at which the damage area is
    <em>maximized</em> (the optimal burst height). In Chelyabinsk, more than 1,600 people were injured —
    mostly by shattered glass — and thousands of buildings were damaged. NASA modeling (Cart3D/ATAP) indicates
    that a suitably “placed” airburst can affect a larger area of serious damage than a localized impact into
    hard ground, while coupling to the ocean generally converts energy poorly into far-field tsunami.

  <div class="callout">
    Airburst = a wide shock-wave footprint; the critical factors are
    <em>energy</em>, <em>height of peak energy deposition</em>, and <em>entry angle</em>.
  </div>

  <h2>Why the footprint is elliptical, not circular</h2>

    </figure>
    <p>
      For an oblique entry, the energy source <em>moves</em> along the trajectory, so the shock front forms
      <strong>anisotropically</strong>. NASA models describe this as an <em>elliptical/“butterfly”</em> footprint:
      the zone of maximum overpressures is oriented downrange along the flight path, with a cross-range decrease.
      This signature is consistently reproduced in high-fidelity simulations and observed in real events.
