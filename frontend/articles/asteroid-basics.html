<p>
    <em>Asteroids</em> are rocky or metallic objects smaller than a planet that orbit the Sun.
    Most asteroids in our Solar System are located in the main asteroid belt, the region between Mars and Jupiter.

    When a fragment breaks off an asteroid, in space it is called a <em>meteoroid</em>.

    A meteoroid that enters the atmosphere flares as a <em>meteor</em>; and if it survives the fall and reaches the ground, it becomes a <strong>meteorite</strong>.

<div class="article-fact">
    <strong>Fact:</strong> Each year Earth accumulates from 20,000 to 40,000 tons of cosmic dust, about 10% of which survives entry into the atmosphere, becoming micrometeorites.
